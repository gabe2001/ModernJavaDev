Define a class called Defect (implement IComparable<Defect>)

- has a severity (0 - 100)
- also has a description

Create a mutable list of Defects and insert some sample data.

Using streams, sort the elements in order of increasing severity,
and then collect into an immutable list.

(Using streams) On the immutable list, get the Defects that have a severity < 50 and display each one.

(Using streams) On the immutable list, get the Defects that have a severity >= 50 and display each one.

(Using streams) Find the Defect with the lowest severity (hint, what if the list of defects is empty?).
Display details about this defect, or display "-1, NO DEFECTS" if none.
